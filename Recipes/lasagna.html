    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>30 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pound thinly sliced mozzarella cheese about 24 slices</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
